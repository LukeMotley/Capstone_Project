# Capstone_Project

## Topic
Stock prices are not solely a result of the quality of a company. Prices are most specifically, based on the perceived quality of a company. If enough people see, spread, and act based off what they see on social media, it can grow to become an equally powerful contributor to stock prices as actual business reports. Certain large media platforms seem to draw these sentiments our where entire communities can form based around a stock or idea. These communities strengthen and reinforce these sentiments causing waves of high volatility and price surges and dips. The questions is, to what degree does social sentiment affect certain stock prices?
For our analysis, we are focusing on a spread of stock classifications varying from income, growth, and penny.


## Why We selected the topic
We were all interested  in how the stock market works, and the various meme stocks like Gamesop and AMC came into the conversation. The conversation slowly grew to how the market as a whole is affected by stocks like Gamestop and AMC getting attention on social media.

## Questions they hope to answer with the data
How is the stock market affected by the surges and dips of GME?
Are certain stocks more correlated in price change to GME?
How is GME and AMC correlated?
Could these price changes be predicted as a new meme stock is growing?
