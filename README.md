## Topic
Stock prices are not soley a result of the quality of a company. Prices are most specifically, based on the preceived quality of a company. If enough people see, spread, and act based off what they see on social media, it can grow to become an equaly powerful contributor to stock prices as actual business reports. Certain large media platforms seem to draw these sentiments our where entire communities can form based around a stock or idea. The questions is, to what degree does social sentiment affect certain stock prices?

For our analysis, we are focusing on a spread of stock classifications varying from income, growth, and penny.





## Why We selected the topic
Luke: I am interested in this topic because I have always had in interest in stocks, but more so focused on the business side, rather than the more socila aspect. After preliminary research, I believe taking social sentiment into account plays a bigger part in the eb and flow of the stock market than I initially thought.

## Questions they hope to answer with the data
Luke: How much will a stock price change when there is a positive and negative sentiment in the social media platform
